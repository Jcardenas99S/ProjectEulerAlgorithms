# ProjectEulerAlgorithms

There we have some algorithms from the project Euler on freecodecamp.


## Algorithms

- [Algorithm #1 - Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/Jcardenas99S/ProjectEulerAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/MultiplesOf3and5.cs) - Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the provided parameter value number.

- [Algorithm #2 - Fibonacci Algorithm](https://github.com/Jcardenas99S/ProjectEulerAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/EvenFibonacciNumbers.cs) - Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 

- [Algorithm #3 - Largest Prime Factor](https://github.com/Jcardenas99S/ProjectEulerAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/LargestPrimeFactor.cs) - What is the largest prime factor of the given number

- [Algorithm #4 - Largest Palindrome Product](https://github.com/Jcardenas99S/ProjectEulerAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/LargestPalindromeProduct.cs) - Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit numbers.

- [Algorithm #5 - Smallest Multiple](https://github.com/Jcardenas99S/ProjectEulerAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/SmallestMultiple.cs) - What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n

- [Algorithm #6 - Sum Square Difference](https://github.com/Jcardenas99S/ProjectEulerAlgorithms/blob/master/Algorithms/SumSquareDifference.cs) - Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of the sum.
